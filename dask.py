# Dask Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to set up a Dask scheduler and workers, and run a simple test script to visualize how the code is being used.

## Setting up the Conda Environment

First, let's create a Conda environment with Python 3.10 and the necessary libraries for machine learning with Dask. Open your terminal and execute the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n dask_env python=3.10
conda activate dask_env
pip install dask distributed
```

These commands will create a new Conda environment called "dask_env" and install the required libraries.

## Starting the Dask Scheduler

Once the environment is set up, you can start the Dask scheduler on one node. Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
dask-scheduler
```

This will start the Dask scheduler.

## Starting the Dask Workers

Next, on each worker node, run the following command to start the worker:

```bash
dask-worker <scheduler-address>
```

Replace `<scheduler-address>` with the address of the Dask scheduler. This command will start the Dask worker and connect it to the scheduler.

## Running a Test Script

Once you have your scheduler and worker(s) running, you can run a test script to see how Dask distributes the computation across the scheduler and workers. Here's an example script:

```python
import dask.array as da

x = da.random.random((10000, 10000), chunks=(1000, 1000))
y = x + x.T
z = y.mean()

print(z.compute())
```

This script creates a Dask array, performs some operations, and computes the result. The computation will be distributed across the scheduler and workers. You can run this script in your Python environment to see the result.

## Connecting to a Remote Dask Scheduler

In the code snippet provided above, the Dask scheduler address is not explicitly specified because the default behavior is to look for a local scheduler. If you are running the code on the same machine as the Dask scheduler, it will automatically connect to the local scheduler.

However, if you need to connect to a remote Dask scheduler, you can modify the code to specify the scheduler address by adding the `client` parameter when creating the Dask array. Here's an updated version of the code:

```python
from dask.distributed import Client
import dask.array as da

client = Client("<scheduler-address>")

x = da.random.random((10000, 10000), chunks=(1000, 1000))
y = x + x.T
z = y.mean()

print(z.compute())
```

Replace `<scheduler-address>` with the actual address of your Dask scheduler, including the IP address and port number.

## Visualizing the Cluster Status

To visualize the status of the Dask cluster, you can use the Dask web interface. Start by installing the `bokeh` library:

```bash
pip install bokeh
```

Then, open the following URL in your browser:

```
http://localhost:8787/status
```

This will show you the Dask dashboard, where you can monitor the status of the scheduler, workers, and the tasks being executed.

## Training a Logistic Regression Model using Dask

Now let's explore a more interesting example, where we train a logistic regression model using Dask. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import dask_ml.datasets as dask_datasets
from dask_ml.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from dask.distributed import Client

# Create a Dask cluster and client
client = Client()

# Load the dataset
X, y = dask_datasets.make_classification(n_samples=100000, n_features=20,
                                          chunks=(10000, 20), random_state=42)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test = X[:80000], X[80000:]
y_train, y_test = y[:80000], y[80000:]

# Create a logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Train the model
with client:
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict the labels for the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Compute the accuracy
accuracy = (y_pred == y_test).mean().compute()

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

In this code, we first import the necessary modules from Dask and Dask-ML. We then create a Dask client to connect to the Dask cluster.

Next, we load a synthetic classification dataset using `dask_datasets.make_classification()`. We split the dataset into training and testing sets using array slicing.

We create a logistic regression model using `LogisticRegression()` from Dask-ML. Using the Dask client context (`with client`), we fit the model on the training data.

We then use the trained model to predict labels for the test set. Finally, we compute the accuracy of the model by comparing the predicted labels (`y_pred`) with the true labels (`y_test`).

## Using Other Libraries with Dask

Dask can be easily integrated with other libraries such as Hydra, scikit-learn,pytorch, and more. Here's an example of using scikit-learn and Hydra with Dask:

```python
import dask_ml.datasets as dask_datasets
from dask_ml.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from dask.distributed import Client
import hydra
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

@hydra.main(config_path="config.yaml")
def train_model(cfg):
    # Load the iris dataset
    iris = load_iris()
    X = iris.data
    y = iris.target

    # Split the data into train and test sets
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

    # Convert the data to Dask arrays
    X_train = da.from_array(X_train, chunks=(100, 4))
    X_test = da.from_array(X_test, chunks=(100, 4))
    y_train = da.from_array(y_train, chunks=100)
    y_test = da.from_array(y_test, chunks=100)

    # Train a Random Forest classifier
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

    # Predict on the test set
    y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

    # Compute accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test.compute(), y_pred.compute())
    print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    train_model()
```

In this example, we use Hydra to load the configuration from a YAML file (`config.yaml`). We define a function `train_model()` as the entry point for our script. Inside this function, we load the iris dataset from scikit-learn and split it into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

Next, we convert the data to Dask arrays using `da.from_array` and specify the `chunks` parameter to control chunk size for distributed computation. We also convert the target variable `y` to a Dask array.

We then create a Random Forest classifier using `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn and fit it on the training data. We predict on the test set and compute the accuracy using `accuracy_score` from scikit-learn. Finally, we print the accuracy.

You can customize the configuration in the `config.yaml` file to adjust the parameters of the Random Forest classifier or other settings.
